# Physical Furniture Detection & Management Guide

## Overview

The AR Interior Design app now includes advanced capabilities for detecting, managing, and interacting with existing physical furniture in your room. This feature allows you to:

- **Detect existing furniture** automatically using AR scanning
- **Hide physical furniture** virtually to create clean design spaces
- **Mark furniture for removal** in your design planning
- **Prevent collisions** between virtual and physical furniture
- **Integrate real and virtual** furniture in your design workflow

## üîç How Physical Furniture Detection Works

### Detection Process

1. **Room Scanning**: The app uses AR Foundation's plane detection to map your room
2. **Grid-based Analysis**: A systematic grid scan across detected floor planes
3. **Ray Casting**: Upward rays from the floor detect objects above
4. **Size Filtering**: Objects must be between 0.3m and 3m in size
5. **Type Classification**: Heuristic-based furniture type estimation
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment of each detection

### Furniture Types Detected

| Type | Detection Criteria |
|------|------------------|
| **Table** | Wide/long, moderate height (0.6-1.2m) |
| **Chair** | Moderate height (0.8-1.3m), small footprint |
| **Sofa** | Long (>1.5m), moderate height (0.6-1.0m) |
| **Bed** | Very long (>1.8m), low height (0.4-0.8m) |
| **Storage** | Tall (>1.2m), boxy shape |
| **Lamp** | Tall (>1.0m), narrow (<0.5m) |
| **Plant** | Variable size, organic detection |

### Detection Accuracy

- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-100% based on size, shape, and surface characteristics
- **Minimum Threshold**: 60% confidence required for detection
- **False Positive Filtering**: Duplicate removal within 0.5m radius
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves with room scanning quality

## üì± Usage Instructions

### Getting Started

1. **Enable Detection**
   ```
   Settings > Physical Furniture > Enable Detection
   ```

2. **Scan Your Room**
   - Look around slowly to map all surfaces
   - Ensure good lighting for better detection
   - Focus on areas with furniture

3. **Review Detections**
   - Check the detected furniture list
   - Verify type classifications
   - Adjust confidence thresholds if needed

### Managing Physical Furniture

#### To Hide Furniture:
1. Open Physical Furniture panel
